Prediction of student academic performance helps instructors develop a good understanding  of how well or how poorly the students in their classes will perform. Students’ feedback is  crucial for academic institutions in order to evaluate faculty performance.

This project utilizes regression analysis and feature-based opinion-mining techniques to extract relevant information from the feedback data.

The implications of this project are significant for educational institutions, as it provides an efficient and accurate way of predicting student performance, allowing for data-driven decision making to improve student outcomes.

Problem Definition:
The project aims to use regression analysis and feature-based opinion mining to extract sentiment and topics from student feedback and use this information to predict academic performance.
